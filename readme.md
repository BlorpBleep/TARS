## Introduction

**TARS** (Transparent Auditable Resilience System) is an open-source solution for secure and verifiable deployment of WireGuard VPN servers. It ensures server integrity and provenance through cryptographic birth certificates and proof-of-life mechanisms. Designed to treat servers as disposable appliances, TARS allows for dynamic scaling while preserving user privacy and anonymity.

---

## Features

- **Cryptographic Birth Certificates**: Verifies the server's initial state upon deployment.
- **Proof-of-Life Signals**: Regularly confirms server integrity and detects tampering.
- **User Privacy Assurance**: Excludes dynamic configurations from integrity checks to maintain anonymity.
- **Scalability**: Supports dynamic addition and removal of servers.
- **Open-Source**: Built entirely with open-source tools and libraries.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Publishes proofs to a public blockchain for transparency.

---

## How It Works

1. **Deployment**: Each server generates a cryptographic birth certificate containing its initial state.
2. **Monitoring**: The server monitors every bit of its system, excluding specified dynamic files.
3. **Proof Publishing**: At regular intervals, the server publishes a proof-of-life hash to a public blockchain.
4. **Verification**: Any party can verify the server's integrity using the public proofs.
5. **Tamper Detection**: Unauthorized changes trigger verification failures and initiate alerts.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux-based OS
- **Dependencies**:
  - WireGuard
  - OpenSSL
  - Python 3.8+
  - Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlorpBleep/TARS.git
   cd TARS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install wireguard openssl python3 python3-pip
   ```

3. **Install Python Packages**

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure TARS**

   - Edit the `config.yaml` file to suit your environment.
   - Specify dynamic files to exclude in the birth certificate.

---

## Usage

### Generating a Birth Certificate

Run the following command to generate a cryptographic birth certificate:

```bash
python3 tars.py --generate-birth-certificate
```

### Starting Proof-of-Life Monitoring

To start the regular proof-of-life checks and publish proofs:

```bash
python3 tars.py --start-monitoring
```

### Verifying Server Integrity

Use the verification script to check server integrity:

```bash
python3 verify.py --server <server_id>
```

---

## Configuration

### `config.yaml` Parameters

- `server_id`: Unique identifier for the server.
- `excluded_files`: List of dynamic files to exclude from integrity checks.
- `proof_interval`: Time interval (in seconds) between proof-of-life publications.
- `blockchain_endpoint`: API endpoint for publishing proofs to the blockchain.

### Example `config.yaml`

```yaml
server_id: "server-12345"
excluded_files:
  - "/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf"
  - "/var/log/*"
proof_interval: 3600
blockchain_endpoint: "https://blockchain.example.com/api/publish"
```
